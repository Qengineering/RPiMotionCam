This application is a fully-featured security Raspberry Pi camera. It can be built with the Raspberry Pi 4, 3 or the tiny Zero 2.<br/>
With an inexpensive RPi V1 camera ($ 7,=), you'll have your security camera up and running in no time.<br/>
You will automatically receive an email when the camera detects a movement.<br/>
At the same time, a video recording will be made and saved to your Google drive.<br/>
You can view your footage in your browser at any time. All for free, at no extra cost.<br/><br/>

## Installation.

- Get a SD-card (min 16 GB) which will hold the image. 
- For the Raspberry Pi **4** download the image Motion_RPi4.xz (2.16 GByte!) from our [Gdrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OrAM2Ls7Mwfz1Iyn6cYq6VS0UUDWQxWL/view?usp=sharing) site.
- For the Raspberry Pi **3** download the image Motion_RPi3.xz (2.16 GByte!) from our [Gdrive]() site.
- For the Raspberry Pi **Zero 2** download the image Motion_RPiZ2.xz (2.16 GByte!) from our [Gdrive]() site.
- Flash the image on the SD-card with the [Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
- Insert the SD-card in your Raspberry Pi.
- Wait a few minutes, while the image will expand to the full size of your SD card.
- No WiFi installed. Password: ***motion***

## Preparations
There are a few settings needed before the application will work properly.<br/>
- First, of course, you need an internet connection. Setup your WiFi or Ethernet as usual.<br/>
After reboot, you must have video footage in your browser. Just give the Raspberry Pi IP, like the http://192.168.178.32 used in the demo video.
- If you want to receive emails and/or store recordings at Google drive, you will need an Google account. Since all your personal login information can be found in the Raspberry Pi, we recommend a separate Google account for this application. Just for safety reasons. 
- Use `$ sudo nano /etc/msmtprc` to give the Google login information. See this [WiKi page](https://github.com/Qengineering/RPiMotionCam/wiki/Email-notification).
- Allow Gmail to process less secure applications. See the [WiKi page](https://github.com/Qengineering/RPiMotionCam/wiki/Email-notification). 
- Get the authorization key from Google for gdrive. Give `$ gdrive about`. See the [WiKi page](https://github.com/Qengineering/RPiMotionCam/wiki/Gdrive-installation#authorization-key). You don't have to install gdrive, it's already on board. You only need the key.
- Last action is the settings file. See the [WiKi page](https://github.com/Qengineering/RPiMotionCam/wiki/Settings).


You have a latency of about 10 seconds. This time is inherent to the HLS streaming. (It takes some time to collect all the information from the stream, get the individual packets and 'glue' them together into one video stream).<br/>
By the way, thanks to this latency, you receive your emails 5 seconds before the actual movement are visible in your browser, allowing you to log in.<br/>
